                        <h2>The Sun</h2>
                        Star Classification: The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, often referred to as a G-dwarf
                        star. It belongs to the spectral class G2V.<br /><br />

                        Size: The Sun is about 109 times the diameter of Earth. To put it in perspective, approximately
                        1.3 million Earths could fit inside the Sun.<br /><br />

                        Composition: The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%). Other
                        trace elements make up the remaining 2%.<br /><br />

                        Energy Source: The Sun's immense energy is generated through nuclear fusion in its core.
                        Hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the
                        process.<br /><br />

                        Temperature: The core temperature of the Sun is estimated to be around 15 million degrees
                        Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), while its surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees
                        Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit).<br /><br />

                        Energy Output: The Sun emits energy in the form of light and heat. It radiates approximately 386
                        billion billion megawatts of power, which is equivalent to the energy produced by about 100
                        billion nuclear bombs exploding every second.<br /><br />

                        Light Travel Time: It takes approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds for sunlight to reach Earth,
                        traveling at the speed of light, which is about 299,792 kilometers (186,282 miles) per
                        second.<br /><br />

                        Magnetic Activity: The Sun experiences an 11-year cycle of solar activity known as the solar
                        cycle. This cycle includes periods of increased solar flares, sunspots, and magnetic
                        disturbances.<br /><br />

                        Gravity: The Sun's gravitational pull is what keeps all the planets in our solar system,
                        including Earth, in orbit. Its gravity is responsible for the elliptical shape of planetary
                        orbits.<br /><br />

                        Age: The Sun is estimated to be around 4.6 billion years old and is roughly middle-aged. It has
                        about 5 billion more years of hydrogen fuel left before it evolves into a red giant and
                        eventually becomes a white dwarf.<br /><br />

                        Understanding the Sun is crucial not only for astrophysics but also for our daily lives, as its
                        energy sustains life on Earth and plays a significant role in our planet's climate and weather
                        patterns.

                    <div class="slider-side-information">
                        <h2>Mercury</h2>Mercury is a rocky, terrestrial planet in our solar system, and it lacks many of
                        the prominent surface features that are found on larger planets like Earth or Mars. However,
                        there are still some notable landmarks and features on Mercury:
                        <br /><br />
                        Caloris Basin: This is one of the most prominent and largest impact basins on Mercury. It
                        measures about 1,550 kilometers (960 miles) in diameter and was formed by a massive asteroid or
                        comet impact early in the planet's history. The basin is surrounded by a series of concentric
                        scarps and contains smooth plains inside it.
                        <br /><br />
                        Scarps: Mercury is known for its numerous thrust fault scarps, which are cliffs or ridges caused
                        by the planet's surface contracting as it cools. These scarps are some of the most distinctive
                        features on the planet. The largest and most famous scarp is the "Great Valley," which stretches
                        for over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and can be up to 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) in height.
                        <br /><br />
                        Craters: Like the Moon, Mercury's surface is heavily cratered due to impacts from asteroids and
                        comets over billions of years. Some notable craters include Kuiper, Hokusai, and Beethoven,
                        among others. Kuiper, for example, is one of the largest and is approximately 240 kilometers
                        (150 miles) in diameter.
                        <br /><br />
                        Plains: Mercury has extensive volcanic plains, some of which are associated with large impact
                        basins. These plains are made up of solidified lava flows and are relatively smooth compared to
                        the heavily cratered highlands.
                        <br /><br />
                        Rachmaninoff Basin: This is another prominent impact basin on Mercury, measuring about 290
                        kilometers (180 miles) in diameter. It has a relatively flat floor and a series of wrinkle
                        ridges along its rim.
                        <br /><br />
                        Messenger's Landing Site: NASA's Messenger spacecraft, which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015,
                        impacted the planet's surface at the end of its mission. While not a natural landmark, the
                        impact site of this spacecraft is significant in terms of planetary exploration history.
                        <br /><br />
                        Polar Deposits: Mercury's poles are known to have water ice and other volatile compounds in
                        permanently shadowed regions of its polar craters. These polar deposits are of great interest to
                        scientists studying the planet's history and geology.
                        <br /><br />
                        It's important to note that our knowledge of Mercury's surface has been greatly enhanced by the
                        data collected by NASA's Messenger spacecraft, which provided valuable insights into the
                        planet's geology and composition. Additionally, new information may continue to emerge as future
                        missions to Mercury are planned and executed.

                    <div class="slider-side-information">
                        <h2>Venus</h2>
                        Venus, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface dominated by volcanic plains and highland
                        regions. Unlike Earth, Venus lacks large bodies of water and has a thick, toxic atmosphere,
                        making its surface features different from our own planet. Here are some of the most important
                        landmarks and features on Venus:
                        <br /><br />
                        Maxwell Montes: Maxwell Montes is the highest mountain range on Venus and one of its most
                        prominent landmarks. These mountains are located near the planet's equator and rise to an
                        altitude of approximately 11 kilometers (7 miles). They are believed to be composed of volcanic
                        rock.
                        <br /><br />
                        Aphrodite Terra: Aphrodite Terra is a large highland region on Venus, roughly the size of
                        Africa, characterized by rugged, mountainous terrain. It is named after the goddess of love,
                        Venus (Aphrodite in Greek mythology).
                        <br /><br />
                        Ishtar Terra: Ishtar Terra is another highland region on Venus, comparable in size to the
                        continent of Australia. It is located in the northern hemisphere and is known for its vast
                        plateaus, mountain ranges, and elevated volcanic features.
                        <br /><br />
                        Coronae: Venus is home to a network of geological features known as coronae. These are circular
                        to oval-shaped structures, often surrounded by concentric rings or ridges. They are thought to
                        result from the upwelling of hot material from Venus's interior.
                        <br /><br />
                        Ovda Regio: Ovda Regio is one of the Venusian highland regions and is characterized by a
                        complex, hilly landscape. It is located in the southern hemisphere and is thought to be one of
                        the oldest surface regions on the planet.
                        <br /><br />
                        Volcanic Plains: Venus's surface is covered by extensive volcanic plains, which are dominated by
                        vast lava flows and volcanic features. The planet's volcanic activity has contributed to its
                        scorching surface temperatures and thick atmosphere.
                        <br /><br />
                        Venusian Impact Craters: Venus has numerous impact craters, but they are relatively few in
                        number compared to other terrestrial planets like Earth or Mars. This is because Venus's thick
                        atmosphere causes many smaller meteoroids to burn up before reaching the surface.
                        <br /><br />
                        Tesserae: Tesserae are highly deformed and fractured regions on Venus's surface, often
                        associated with complex tectonic processes. They are characterized by a polygonal, blocky
                        appearance and are believed to be the result of compressional forces.
                        <br /><br />
                        Pancake Domes: These are small, circular, and relatively flat volcanic domes scattered across
                        Venus's surface. They are believed to have formed from the extrusion of thick, viscous lava.
                        <br /><br />
                        Venusian Impact Features: While Venus has fewer impact craters than other planets, it does have
                        a variety of impact-related features, including central peaks and ring-shaped structures within
                        some impact craters.
                        <br /><br />
                        It's worth noting that our understanding of Venus's surface has been greatly advanced by
                        spacecraft missions like NASA's Magellan, which used radar imaging to map the planet's surface.
                        Venus's extreme surface conditions, including high temperatures and pressures, make it
                        challenging for landers and rovers to explore the planet, so most of our knowledge comes from
                        remote sensing missions.

                        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                        Jupiter is a gas giant, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and it lacks a solid surface
                        like terrestrial planets. As a result, it doesn't have the traditional surface landmarks found
                        on rocky planets. Instead, the notable features of Jupiter are its atmospheric phenomena and
                        massive storms. Here are some of the most important "landmarks" on Jupiter:
                        <br /><br />
                        Great Red Spot: The Great Red Spot is perhaps the most famous feature on Jupiter. It is a
                        massive, persistent anticyclonic storm that has been observed for at least 350 years. It is
                        larger than Earth and is characterized by its reddish color. It is a high-pressure region in
                        Jupiter's atmosphere.
                        <br /><br />
                        Jupiter's Cloud Bands: Jupiter's atmosphere is marked by alternating light and dark cloud bands,
                        which are caused by differences in temperature and chemical composition. These bands are made up
                        of clouds of ammonia and water vapor and are a prominent feature when viewing Jupiter through a
                        telescope.
                        <br /><br />
                        Zones and Belts: The cloud bands on Jupiter are organized into distinct zones (light-colored)
                        and belts (dark-colored). The zones are high-pressure regions, while the belts are low-pressure
                        regions. They are responsible for the planet's striped appearance.
                        <br /><br />
                        Oval Storms: Jupiter is home to numerous oval-shaped storms, some of which are large and
                        long-lasting. These storms, like the Great Red Spot, are anticyclonic and can persist for
                        extended periods.
                        <br /><br />
                        The South Equatorial Belt Disturbance: In 2020, an unusual and prominent feature known as the
                        South Equatorial Belt Disturbance appeared in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. It was
                        characterized by a white storm-like cloud that was notable for its size and appearance.
                        <br /><br />
                        Juno's Perijove Passes: The Juno spacecraft, launched by NASA in 2011, has been orbiting Jupiter
                        and conducting close flybys of the planet. During its perijove passes, Juno has captured
                        stunning images and valuable data about Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior
                        structure.
                        <br /><br />
                        Jovian Moons: While not features of Jupiter itself, the planet's four largest moons—Io, Europa,
                        Ganymede, and Callisto—are significant landmarks in the Jovian system. They are known as the
                        Galilean moons and were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
                        <br /><br />
                        Northern and Southern Auroras: Jupiter's powerful magnetic field generates spectacular auroras
                        in its polar regions. These auroras are similar to Earth's Northern and Southern Lights and are
                        produced when charged particles from the Sun interact with Jupiter's magnetic field.
                        <br /><br />
                        Jupiter's Rings: Jupiter has a faint ring system, though it is not as prominent as Saturn's. The
                        main ring, known as the "Main Ring," is composed of dust particles and is difficult to see from
                        Earth.
                        <br /><br />
                        Rapid Rotation: While not a visible feature, Jupiter's incredibly rapid rotation is worth
                        mentioning. The planet completes a full rotation in just under 10 hours, leading to its oblate
                        shape (flattened at the poles).
                        <br /><br />
                        Jupiter's dynamic and ever-changing atmosphere, along with its iconic Great Red Spot and
                        numerous storms, make it a fascinating object of study for astronomers and planetary scientists.
                        Ongoing missions and telescopic observations continue to reveal new insights into the largest
                        planet in our solar system.

                        <h2>Saturn</h2>
                        Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is known for its stunning ring system and a variety of
                        atmospheric and planetary features. While Saturn does not have traditional surface landmarks
                        like rocky planets, it has several remarkable features that make it a unique and captivating
                        world:
                        <br /><br />
                        Saturn's Rings: Saturn's iconic ring system is undoubtedly its most famous feature. These rings
                        are made up of countless particles of ice and rock, ranging in size from tiny grains to several
                        meters in diameter. Saturn's ring system is divided into several major rings, including the A,
                        B, and C rings, and it consists of multiple gaps, divisions, and narrower ringlets. The rings
                        are an ongoing subject of scientific study and have fascinated astronomers and space enthusiasts
                        for centuries.
                        <br /><br />
                        Cassini Division: The Cassini Division is a prominent gap between Saturn's A and B rings. It was
                        named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini, who first observed it in the 17th century.
                        The division is caused by gravitational interactions with Saturn's moon Mimas and is a striking
                        feature when viewed through a telescope.
                        <br /><br />
                        Saturn's Hexagon: Saturn's north pole features a bizarre and mesmerizing hexagonal cloud
                        pattern, often referred to as Saturn's hexagon. This hexagon is approximately 32,000 kilometers
                        (20,000 miles) in diameter and is composed of high-speed winds that form a six-sided jet stream.
                        <br /><br />
                        The Great White Spot: Saturn experiences periodic storms, and the Great White Spot is one of the
                        most significant. These storms are visible as large, bright white areas in Saturn's atmosphere.
                        The Great White Spot occurs roughly every 20 to 30 years and is associated with powerful
                        atmospheric disturbances.
                        <br /><br />
                        Titan: Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is a landmark in its own right. It is the only moon in the
                        solar system with a thick atmosphere and a landscape shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid
                        hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane. Titan has been the target of exploration missions like
                        NASA's Cassini-Huygens, which provided valuable insights into this intriguing moon.
                        <br /><br />
                        Enceladus: Another of Saturn's moons, Enceladus, is known for its geysers of water vapor and ice
                        that erupt from its south polar region. These geysers suggest the presence of a subsurface
                        ocean, making Enceladus a prime candidate for the search for life beyond Earth.
                        <br /><br />
                        Iapetus: Saturn's moon Iapetus is known for its dramatic color contrast. One hemisphere is much
                        darker than the other, giving it a distinct yin-yang appearance. This contrast is due to the
                        accumulation of dark material on one side, possibly from material ejected by another moon,
                        Phoebe.
                        <br /><br />
                        Cassini-Huygens Mission: While not a physical landmark, the Cassini-Huygens mission, a joint
                        effort by NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and ASI (Italian Space Agency), was a significant
                        milestone in the study of Saturn. The mission provided a wealth of data about Saturn's rings,
                        atmosphere, and moons, transforming our understanding of the planet and its system.
                        <br /><br />
                        Saturn's captivating features, including its magnificent ring system, unique atmospheric
                        patterns, and diverse moon system, make it a subject of continued scientific interest and
                        exploration. Future missions to Saturn and its moons are expected to reveal even more about this
                        remarkable planet and its celestial companions.

                        <h2>Uranus</h2>
                        Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant and primarily consists of hydrogen and
                        helium. Unlike terrestrial planets, Uranus lacks prominent surface landmarks like mountains,
                        valleys, and craters due to its thick atmosphere and the absence of a solid surface.
                        Nevertheless, there are a few features and characteristics of Uranus that stand out:
                        <br /><br />
                        Extreme Axial Tilt: Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Uranus is its extreme axial tilt.
                        Unlike most planets in the solar system, which have relatively small tilts, Uranus is tilted
                        almost 98 degrees on its side, appearing to roll along its orbital path. This unique tilt gives
                        Uranus its distinct appearance and results in extreme seasonal variations.
                        <br /><br />
                        Rings: Uranus has a system of narrow and faint rings that encircle the planet. The ring system
                        consists of 13 known rings, which are named after astronomers, including the outermost Epsilon
                        ring, the brightest Alpha and Beta rings, and the broad and diffuse Adams ring. These rings were
                        discovered using the occultation method when Uranus passed in front of a star.
                        <br /><br />
                        Moons: Uranus has a relatively extensive moon system. It has 27 known moons, and among the
                        notable ones are:
                        <br /><br />
                        Titania: The largest moon of Uranus, Titania, has a diameter of about 1,578 kilometers (981
                        miles) and is known for its heavily cratered surface.
                        Oberon: Oberon is another major moon of Uranus, with a diameter of about 1,523 kilometers (947
                        miles). It is one of the darkest moons in the solar system.
                        Miranda: Miranda is a smaller moon with a unique and highly varied surface. It has cliffs,
                        canyons, and other intriguing geological features.
                        Atmospheric Bands: While not visible through telescopes, Uranus has an atmosphere composed
                        mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The planet's atmosphere displays faint bands of clouds,
                        which are mostly featureless and less prominent compared to the atmospheric bands of Jupiter and
                        Saturn.
                        <br /><br />
                        Magnetic Field: Uranus has a unique magnetic field. Unlike most planets whose magnetic fields
                        are roughly aligned with their rotational axes, Uranus's magnetic field is highly tilted and
                        offset from its center. This peculiarity remains an area of scientific interest and study.
                        <br /><br />
                        Discovery and Observation: Uranus was the first planet to be discovered with a telescope. It was
                        initially observed by German-born British astronomer Sir William Herschel in 1781. Before
                        Herschel's discovery, Uranus was thought to be a star. Subsequent observations have provided
                        additional insights into the planet and its moons.
                        <br /><br />
                        It's important to note that our understanding of Uranus is still relatively limited compared to
                        other planets in the solar system due to its considerable distance from Earth and the lack of
                        dedicated missions. Future missions to Uranus may provide more information about its unique
                        features and characteristics.

                        Great Dark Spot: The Great Dark Spot is one of the most prominent features in Neptune's
                        atmosphere. It is a massive, dark storm system that was first observed by the Voyager 2
                        spacecraft during its flyby in 1989. Similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, it's an anticyclonic
                        storm with winds that can reach speeds of up to 1,500 kilometers per hour (930 miles per hour).
                        However, unlike Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the Great Dark Spot on Neptune is not a permanent
                        feature and can change in size and location.
                        <br /><br />
                        Other Storms: In addition to the Great Dark Spot, Neptune's atmosphere is filled with other
                        storm systems and cloud bands. These features are constantly changing and can provide valuable
                        insights into the planet's dynamic weather patterns.
                        <br /><br />
                        Trident: The Trident is a dark, three-pronged feature in Neptune's northern hemisphere. It was
                        first observed in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2015. While the exact nature of
                        the Trident is still a subject of study, it is believed to be a disturbance in the planet's
                        atmosphere.
                        <br /><br />
                        Neptune's Rings: Neptune has a faint and complex ring system composed of several narrow and
                        faint rings. These rings are difficult to observe from Earth and were first discovered in 1984
                        when they temporarily blocked the light from a distant star. The rings are named after
                        astronomers and mythological figures, including Galle, Le Verrier, and Lassell.
                        <br /><br />
                        Neptune's Moons: Neptune has a diverse system of moons, with 14 known moons as of my last
                        knowledge update in September 2021. The largest moon, Triton, is especially significant due to
                        its unique characteristics. Triton is one of the few moons in the solar system that orbits its
                        planet in a retrograde, or backward, direction, suggesting it may have been captured by
                        Neptune's gravity. It also has a thin atmosphere and geysers that erupt nitrogen gas into space.
                        <br /><br />
                        Neptune's Color: Neptune's bluish appearance is due to the presence of methane in its
                        atmosphere. Methane absorbs red light and reflects blue light, giving the planet its distinctive
                        color.
                        <br /><br />
                        Neptune's Magnetic Field: Neptune has a strong and tilted magnetic field, which is tilted at an
                        angle of about 47 degrees relative to its rotational axis. This magnetic field is believed to be
                        generated by a dynamic liquid metallic hydrogen layer deep within the planet.
                        <br /><br />
                        Voyager 2 Flyby: The Voyager 2 spacecraft made a historic flyby of Neptune in 1989, providing
                        the most detailed and close-up observations of the planet to date. It captured images of
                        Neptune's rings, moons, and the Great Dark Spot, greatly advancing our understanding of this
                        distant ice giant.
                        <br /><br />
                        Neptune remains a subject of ongoing scientific study, and future missions and telescopic
                        observations may reveal more about its dynamic atmosphere and intriguing features.
